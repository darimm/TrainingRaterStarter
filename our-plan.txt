Implementing Authentication
  - Hashing mechanism. Don't store passwords in plain text
  - Create a user endpoint (already exists for us)
  - Login Endpoint
  --JSON Web Tokens
    --Handle tokens coming from the front end
    ---Passport (handles authentication) - Can use multiple strategies (google, facebook, twitter, JWT, etc) - Works with Express very well
    ---JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
  - Method to compare what was entered to the database. (Inside login route), and grant tokens.
  - Add authentication to endpoints

  - Hashing will be done with bcrypt
   - you never actually pull the password out of the database, you just hash it and compare the hash.
   

Flow:
Computer sends to server, server sends to node/express app, app sends to router, router sends to controller
Middleware sits in the middle of the request after it hits your app but before the route. Passport will live there, and BodyParser does live there
You must allow login page to work unauthenticated, but otherwise it should check authentication.
User roles are also handled in this space, though we will not be using them here.
